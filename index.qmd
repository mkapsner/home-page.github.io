# About me

I am a researcher with more than 15 years experience answering questions about communication, perception, and movement. I love figuring out how to ask the right questions, collect useful data, and set up informative models. I have worked in diverse settings and I have collaborated with engineers, neuroscientists, physicians, and rehabilitation professionals. What keeps me motivated is the joy of collaborating with a team and constant learning.

I have led [projects](projects/index.qmd) examining sensorimotor control of speech, predicting diagnoses from acoustic measures, and improving clinical outcomes measurement. These projects have allowed me to develop and leverage skills including research design, statistical modeling (t test, ANOVA, linear and logistic regression, structural equation modeling, nonparametric statistics, ICCs) and coding (R, SPSS, Stata), scripting (MATLAB), signal acquisition and processing (acoustic, aerodynamic, surface electromyography), data visualization, [technical writing](publications/index.qmd), and [science communication](presentations/index.qmd). I also have extensive experience with mentorship and teaching in research, clinic, and classroom settings.

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:mara@kapsner.org) if you would like to learn more or discuss potential projects.
