# About me

I am an experienced research scientist with a passion for developing measures to derive meaning from complex human-generated signals. I have a deep background in speech science. My strengths include research design, working with complex audio and electrophysiological hardware, signal collection and processing, statistical modeling, and cross-functional collaboration. Proven ability to translate research findings into actionable recommendations and communicate effectively with stakeholders. I am committed to team science and motivated by the joy of constant learning.

I have led end-to-end [projects](projects/index.qmd) examining sensorimotor control of speech, predictive modeling of acoustic measures for detection of voice disorders, and human factors and user-centered outcomes measurement. My technical skills include statistical modeling (t test, ANOVA, linear and logistic regression, structural equation modeling, nonparametric statistics, ICCs), coding (Python, R, Matlab, SPSS), signal processing, data visualization, [technical writing](publications/index.qmd), and [science communication](presentations/index.qmd). I also have extensive experience with mentorship and teaching in research, clinic, and classroom settings.
